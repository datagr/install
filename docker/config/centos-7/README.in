flow {version}
==============
This is a binary distribution of flow version {version} along with the required
support libraries.


enable: The file enable is a small shell script which can be used to initialize
   the environment for flow. This file must be edited manually by the system
   administator after unpacking the tar distribution. The enable script updates
   the LD_LIBRARY_PATH and PATH environment variables, there is nothing special
   about the enable script, and if desirable the environment can be manipulated
   in a different fashion.


tesdata/: The testdata folder contains two testcases which can be used to test
   the flow installation, the case SPE1.DATA which is a very small testcase, and
   norne/NORNE_ATW2013 which is a real model for the Norne field contributed for
   open distributiond by Equinor ASA.


usr/: The usr folder is the root of the flow binary distribution, the usr folder
    contains the "normal" lib64/ and bin/ subfolders with shared libraries and
    executable respectively. The purpose of the enable script is to ensure that
    the shell and runtime linker finds the binaries and libraries located in the
    usr/ folder correctly.


Running scalar flow: Assuming that the $root variable in the enable script has
been correctly updated flow can be run as follows:

   bash% source {flow-prefix}/enable
   bash% flow {flow_prefix}/testdata/SPE1.DATA

Oberve that two different versions of flow are compiled, one with MPI support
and one without. The two binaries are both named 'flow', it is therefor
important that not both are in PATH simultaneously.
